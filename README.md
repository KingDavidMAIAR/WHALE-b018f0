⭐The importance of whales🐳

Whales occupy a place in the marine food web, thus contributing to the balance of the ecosystem. Once fed, these large mammals send insane amounts of nutrients back to areas that lack them.

On their way to their great migrations, for example. Unlike fish droppings, which sink to the bottom of the ocean, whale droppings, which are rich in iron and nitrogen, actually float on the surface, feeding on phytoplankton. In turn, these algae absorb some of the carbon from the atmosphere. The greenhouse gas is then carried to the bottom of the water when the algae die off.

This is how whales, whether at the surface or at depth, participate in carbon capture. By throwing fertilizer into the oceans. Remember that phytoplankton absorb around 37 billion tonnes per year, or around 40% of all the CO2 produced.

This is equivalent to the amount of CO2 captured by 1,700 billion trees. Given the importance of the process, a team of economists recently attempted to quantify the contribution of whales in the fight against global warming.

Our roadmap is to promote the involvement and participation of all in the safeguard of our oceanic resources and all living beings therein.

By developing the ecosystem of WhaleCoin holders, our community will be able to lead ecological and economic initiatives.

We are counting on your involvement and your charity, our NFT Charity sales system allows us to finance our young promising project.
